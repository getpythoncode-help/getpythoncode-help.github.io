            <p>The distance between two letters in the English alphabet is one more than the number of letters between them. Alternatively, it can be defined as the number of steps needed to move from the alphabetically smaller letter to the larger letter. This is always a non-negative integer. For example: The distance between two words is defined as follows: It is -1, if the words are f unequal lengths. If the word-lengths are equal, it is the sum of the distances between letters at corresponding positions in the words. For example:​dword​(dog,cat)=dletter​(d,c)+dletter​(o,a)+dletter​(g,t)=1+14+13=28 Write a function named distance that accepts two words as arguments and returns the distance between them. You do not have to accept input from the user or print output to the console. You just have to write the function definition.</p>

            <p>P is a dictionary of father-son relationships that has the following structure: for any key in the dictionary, its corresponding value is the father of key. As an example: P = { 'Jahangir': 'Akbar', 'Akbar': 'Humayun', 'Humayun': 'Babur' } If 'Jahangir' is the key, then 'Akbar', his father, is the value. This is true of every key in the dictionary. Write a recursive function named ancestry that accepts the following arguments: P: a dictionary of relationships present: name of a person, string past: name of a person, string It should return the sequence of ancestors of the person named present, traced back up to the person named past. For example, ancestry(P, 'Jahangir', 'Babur') should return the list: L = ['Jahangir', 'Akbar', 'Humayun', 'Babur'] In more Pythonic terms, L[i] is the father of L[i - 1], for 1≤ i < len(L), with the condition that L[0] should be present and L[-1] should be past. (1) You can assume that no two persons in the dictionary have the same name. However, a given person could either appear as a key or as a value in the dictionary. (2) A given person could appear multiple times as one of the values of the dictionary. For example, in test-case-2, Prasanna has two sons, Mohan and Krishna, and hence appears twice (as a value). (3) You do not have to accept input from the user or print output to the console. You just have to write the function definition.</span>

  if present not in P:

            <p>Fibonacci Fibonacci is a young resident of the Italian city of Pisa. He spends a lot of time visiting the Leaning Tower of Pisa, one of the iconic buildings in the city, that is situated close to his home. During all his visits to the tower, he plays a strange game while climbing the marble steps of the tower. The Game Fibonacci likes to climb the steps either one at a time, two at a time, or three at a time. This adds variety to the otherwise monotonous task of climbing. He wants to find the total number of ways in which he can climb n steps, if the order of his individual steps matters. Your task is to help Fibonacci compute this number. For example, if he wishes to climb three steps, in the case of n=3, he could do it in four different ways: (1,1,1) (1,1,1): do it in three moves, one step at a time (1,2) (1,2): do it in two moves, first take a single step, then a double step (2,1) (2,1): do it in two moves, first take a double step, then a single step (3): do it in just one move, directly leaping to the third step To take another example, if n=5, then some of the sequences could be: (1,3,1), (1,1,3), (3,1,1), (2,1,1,1), (1,2,1,1), (2,1,2) Each sequence is one of the ways of climbing five steps. The point to note here is that each element of a sequence can only be 1, 2, or 3. Write a recursive function named steps that accepts a positive integer n as the argument. It should return the total number of ways in which Fibonacci can ascend n steps. Note that the order of his steps is important. You do not have to accept input from the user or print output to the console. You just have to write the function definition.</span>
            <pre><code class="language-css">def steps(n):
  if n <= 0:
    return 0
  elif n == 1:
    return 1
  elif n == 2:
    return 2
  elif n == 3:
    return 4


  one_steps = steps(n-1)
  
  two_steps = steps(n-2)
  
  three_steps = steps(n-3)

  return(one_steps + two_steps + three_steps)

            <p>Consider a grid-world of size n×n. You are at the bottom-left corner, at the cell (1,1), to start with. A sample grid-world for the case of n=5 is given below for your reference: You can move one step at a time in any one of the four directions: "North", "East", "West", "South". At every cell of the grid, all four moves are possible. The only catch is that if you make a move that will take you out of the grid at a border cell, you will stay put at the same cell. Concretely, if you are at the cell (1,4) and try to move west, you will remain at the same cell. Or if you are at (3,1) and try to move south, you will remain there. Write a function named final that accepts a positive integer n and a sequence of moves (string) as arguments and returns the final position where you would end up in an n×n grid-world if you start at (1,1). You must return a tuple of size 2, where the first element is the x-coordinate and the second is the y-coordinate.</span>
