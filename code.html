                Write three Python functions as specified below. Paste the text for all three functions together into the submission window. Your function will be called automatically with various inputs and should return values as specified. Do not write commands to read any input or print any output. You may define additional auxiliary functions as needed. In all cases you may assume that the value passed to the function is of the expected type, so your function does not have to check for malformed inputs. For each function, there are normally some public test cases and some (hidden) private test cases. "Compile and run" will evaluate your submission against the public test cases. "Submit" will evaluate your submission against the hidden private test cases. There are 12 private test cases, with equal weightage. You will get feedback about which private test cases pass or fail, though you cannot see the actual test cases. Ignore warnings about "Presentation errors".
                1. We represent scores of batsmen across a sequence of matches in a two level dictionary as follows: {'match1':{'player1':57, 'player2':38}, 'match2':{'player3':9, 'player1':42}, 'match3':{'player2':41, 'player4':63, 'player3':91} Each match is identified by a string, as is each player. The scores are all integers. The names associated with the matches are not fixed (here they are 'match1', 'match2', 'match3'), nor are the names of the players. A player need not have a score recorded in all matches. Define a Python function orangecap(d) that reads a dictionary d of this form and identifies the player with the highest total score. Your function should return a pair (playername,topscore) where playername is a string, the name of the player with the highest score, and topscore is an integer, the total score of playername. The input will be such that there are never any ties for highest total score. For instance: >>> orangecap({'match1':{'player1':57, 'player2':38}, 'match2':{'player3':9, 'player1':42}, 'match3':{'player2':41, 'player4':63, 'player3':91}}) ('player3', 100) >>> orangecap({'test1':{'Pant':84, 'Kohli':120}, 'test2':{'Pant':59, 'Gill':42}}) ('Pant', 143)
                2.Let us consider polynomials in a single variable x with integer coefficients. For instance: 3x4 - 17x2 - 3x + 5 Each term of the polynomial can be represented as a pair of integers (coefficient,exponent). The polynomial itself is then a list of such pairs. We have the following constraints to guarantee that each polynomial has a unique representation: Terms are sorted in descending order of exponent No term has a zero cofficient No two terms have the same exponent Exponents are always nonnegative For example, the polynomial introduced earlier is represented as: [(3,4),(-17,2),(-3,1),(5,0)] The zero polynomial, 0, is represented as the empty list [], since it has no terms with nonzero coefficients. Write Python functions for the following operations: addpoly(p1,p2) multpoly(p1,p2) that add and multiply two polynomials, respectively. You may assume that the inputs to these functions follow the representation given above. Correspondingly, the outputs from these functions should also obey the same constraints. You can write auxiliary functions to "clean up" polynomials â€“ e.g., remove zero coefficient terms, combine like terms, sort by exponent etc. Build a library of functions that can be combined to achieve the desired format. You may also want to convert the list representation to a dictionary representation and manipulate the dictionary representation, and then convert back. Some examples: >>> addpoly([(4,3),(3,0)],[(-4,3),(2,1)]) [(2, 1),(3, 0)] Explanation: (4x^3 + 3) + (-4x^3 + 2x) = 2x + 3 >>> addpoly([(2,1)],[(-2,1)]) [] Explanation: 2x + (-2x) = 0 >>> multpoly([(1,1),(-1,0)],[(1,2),(1,1),(1,0)]) [(1, 3),(-1, 0)] Explanation: (x - 1) * (x^2 + x + 1) = x^3 - 1

            <h1>Week 5: Programming Assignment <span>Due on 2024-02-29, 23:59 IST</span></h1>
            <p>For this assignment, you have to write a complete Python program. Paste your code in the window below. You may define additional auxiliary functions as needed. There are some public test cases and some (hidden) private test cases. "Compile and run" will evaluate your submission against the public test cases "Submit" will evaluate your submission against the hidden private test cases. There are 6 private test cases, with equal weightage. You will get feedback about which private test cases pass or fail, though you cannot see the actual test cases. Ignore warnings about "Presentation errors". Here are some basic facts about tennis scoring: A tennis match is made up of sets. A set is made up of games. To win a set, a player has to win 6 games with a difference of 2 games. At 6-6, there is often a special tie-breaker. In some cases, players go on playing till one of them wins the set with a difference of two games. Tennis matches can be either 3 sets or 5 sets. The player who wins a majority of sets wins the match (i.e., 2 out 3 sets or 3 out of 5 sets) The score of a match lists out the games in each set, with the overall winner's score reported first for each set. Thus, if the score is 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 it means that the first player won the first set by 6 games to 3, lost the second one 5 games to 7 and won the third one 7 games to 6 (and hence won the overall match as well by 2 sets to 1). You will read input from the keyboard (standard input) containing the results of several tennis matches. Each match's score is recorded on a separate line with the following format: Winner:Loser:Set-1-score,...,Set-k-score, where 2 â‰¤ k â‰¤ 5 For example, an input line of the form Osaka:Barty:3-6,6-3,6-3 indicates that Osaka beat Barty 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 in a best of 3 set match. The input is terminated by a blank line. You have to write a Python program that reads information about all the matches and compile the following statistics for each player: Number of best-of-5 set matches won Number of best-of-3 set matches won Number of sets won Number of games won Number of sets lost Number of games lost You should print out to the screen (standard output) a summary in decreasing order of ranking, where the ranking is according to the criteria 1-6 in that order (compare item 1, if equal compare item 2, if equal compare item 3 etc, noting that for items 5 and 6 the comparison is reversed). For instance, given the following data Zverev:Medvedev:2-6,6-7,7-6,6-3,6-1 Barty:Osaka:6-4,6-4 Medvedev:Zverev:6-3,6-3 Osaka:Barty:1-6,7-5,6-2 Zverev:Medvedev:6-0,7-6,6-3 Osaka:Barty:2-6,6-2,6-0 Medvedev:Zverev:6-3,4-6,6-3,6-4 Barty:Osaka:6-1,3-6,7-5 Zverev:Medvedev:7-6,4-6,7-6,2-6,6-2 Osaka:Barty:6-4,1-6,6-3 Medvedev:Zverev:7-5,7-5 Osaka:Barty:3-6,6-3,6-3 your program should print out the following Zverev 3 0 10 104 11 106 Medvedev 1 2 11 106 10 104 Osaka 0 4 9 76 8 74 Barty 0 2 8 74 9 76 You can assume that there are no spaces around the punctuation marks ":", "-" and ",". Each player's name will be spelled consistently and no two players have the same name.</p>
