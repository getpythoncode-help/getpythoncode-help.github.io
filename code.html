	 Write 2 Python functions as specified below. Paste the text for all three functions together into the submission window. Your function will be called automatically with various inputs and should return values as specified. Do not write commands to read any input or print any output.
You may define additional auxiliary functions as needed.
In all cases you may assume that the value passed to the function is of the expected type, so your function does not have to check for malformed inputs.
For each function, there are normally some public test cases and some (hidden) private test cases.
"Compile and run" will evaluate your submission against the public test cases.
"Submit" will evaluate your submission against the hidden private test cases. There are 12 private test cases, with equal weightage. You will get feedback about which private test cases pass or fail, though you cannot see the actual test cases.
Ignore warnings about "Presentation errors".

		   1.Write a Python function frequency(l) that takes as input a list of integers and returns a pair of the form (minfreqlist,maxfreqlist) where

minfreqlist is a list of numbers with minimum frequency in l, sorted in ascending order
maxfreqlist is a list of numbers with maximum frequency in l, sorted in ascending order
Here are some examples of how your function should work.

>>> frequency([13,12,11,13,14,13,7,11,13,14,12])
([7], [13])

>>> frequency([13,12,11,13,14,13,7,11,13,14,12,14,14])
([7], [13, 14])

>>> frequency([13,12,11,13,14,13,7,11,13,14,12,14,14,7])
([7, 11, 12], [13, 14])

		    2.An airline has assigned each city that it serves a unique numeric code. It has collected information about all the direct flights it operates, represented as a list of pairs of the form (i,j), where i is the code of the starting city and j is the code of the destination.

It now wants to compute all pairs of cities connected by one intermediate hope — city i is connected to city j by one intermediate hop if there are direct flights of the form (i,k) and (k,j) for some other city k. The airline is only interested in one hop flights between different cities — pairs of the form (i,i) are not useful.

Write a Python function onehop(l) that takes as input a list of pairs representing direct flights, as described above, and returns a list of all pairs (i,j), where i != j, such that i and j are connected by one hop. Note that it may already be the case that there is a direct flight from i to j. So long as there is an intermediate k with a flight from i to k and from k to j, the list returned by the function should include (i,j). The input list may be in any order. The pairs in the output list should be in lexicographic (dictionary) order. Each pair should be listed exactly once.

Here are some examples of how your function should work.

 
>>> onehop([(2,3),(1,2)])
[(1, 3)]

>>> onehop([(2,3),(1,2),(3,1),(1,3),(3,2),(2,4),(4,1)])
[(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 2), (4, 3)]

>>> onehop([(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)])
[]
<!-- 3.Write a function sumprimes(l) that takes as input a list of integers l and retuns the sum of all the prime numbers in l.

Here are some examples to show how your function should work.

>>> sumprimes([3,3,1,13])
19
>>> sumprimes([2,4,6,9,11])
13
>>> sumprimes([-3,1,6])

<a>The Programming Data Structure And Algorithm using python week 8 programming answers [Due on 2024-09-19, 23:59 IST]</a>
                <p> Week 8: Programming Assignment</p>
	    <p>

For this assignment, you have to write a complete Python program. Paste your code in the window below.

You may define additional auxiliary functions as needed.
In all cases you may assume that the input to your program has the expected format, so your program does not have to check for malformed inputs.
There are some public test cases and some (hidden) private test cases.
"Compile and run" will evaluate your submission against the public test cases.
"Submit" will evaluate your submission against the hidden private test cases. There are 6 private test cases, with equal weightage. You will get feedback about which private test cases pass or fail, though you cannot see the actual test cases.
Ignore warnings about "Presentation errors".

IOI Training Camp 20xx
(INOI 2011)

We are well into the 21st century and school children are taught dynamic programming in class 4. The IOI training camp has degenerated into an endless sequence of tests, with negative marking. At the end of the camp, each student is evaluated based on the sum of the best contiguous segment (i.e., no gaps) of marks in the overall sequence of tests.

Students, however, have not changed much over the years and they have asked for some relaxation in the evaluation procedure. As a concession, the camp coordinators have agreed that students are allowed to drop upto a certain number of tests when calculating their best segment.

For instance, suppose that Lavanya is a student at the training camp and there have been ten tests, in which her marks are as follows.

Test	  1  	   2  	  3  	   4  	  5  	   6  	   7  	   8  	   9  	  10  
Marks	  6  	  -5  	  3  	  -7  	  6  	  -1  	  10  	  -8  	  -8  	  8  
In this case, without being allowed to drop any tests, the best segment is tests 5–7, which yields a total of 15 marks. If Lavanya is allowed to drop upto 2 tests in a segment, the best segment is tests 1–7, which yields a total of 24 marks after dropping tests 2 and 4. If she is allowed to drop upto 6 tests in a segment, the best total is obtained by taking the entire list and dropping the 5 negative entries to get a total of 33.

You will be given a sequence of N test marks and a number K. You have to compute the sum of the best segment in the sequence when upto K marks may be dropped from the segment.

Solution hint
For 1 ≤ i ≤ N, 1 ≤ j ≤ K, let Best[i][j] denote the maximum segment ending at position i with at most j marks dropped. Best[i][0] is the classical maximum subsegment or maximum subarray problem. For j ≥ 1; inductively compute Best[i][j] from Best[i][j-1].

Input format
The first line of input contains two integers N and K, where N is the number of tests for which marks will be provided and K is the limit of how many entries may be dropped from a segment.

This is followed by N lines of input each containing a single integer. The marks for test i, i ∈ {1,2,…,N} are provided in line i+1.

Output format
The output is a single number, the maximum marks that can be obtained from a segment in which upto K values are dropped.

Constraints
You may assume that 1 ≤ N ≤ 104 and 0 ≤ K ≤ 102. The marks for each test lie in the range [-104 … 104]. In 40% of the cases you may assume N ≤ 250.

Example:
We now illustrate the input and output formats using the example described above.
Sample input:
10 2
6
-5
3
-7
6
-1
10
-8
-8
8
Sample output:
